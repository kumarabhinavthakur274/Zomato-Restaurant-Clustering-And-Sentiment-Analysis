# Zomato Restaurant Clustering and Sentiment Analysis
This is a project that uses machine learning techniques to cluster restaurants based on certain features and analyze the sentiment of customer reviews for those restaurants. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook file named : 
"Kumar_Abhinav_Zomato_Restaurant_Clustering_And_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb".

## Project Overview
The project has the following main objectives:

* Cluster restaurants based on certain features such as location, rating, and cuisine.
